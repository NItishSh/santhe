- API Framework: FastAPI
- Analytics Engine: Apache Superset (for interactive dashboards)
- Visualization Library: Matplotlib (for generating reports)

## Setup and Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
   export SUPERTABLE_URL=https://your-supertable-url.com
   export MATPLOTLIB_BACKEND=Agg
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. Start the service:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Testing

To run tests:
```
pytest
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is available at `/docs` after starting the service.

## Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of data submission endpoints
- Use strong encryption for storing sensitive data
- Regularly update dependencies and security patches
